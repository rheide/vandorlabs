# Changelog

## 1.2

### Added

- 32 new selectable housing finishes from the shared `textures` artwork folder, covering two variants of 16 metal, floor, wall, conduit and technology materials. They are available across Programmable Blocks and the other blocks that share the housing finish menu.
- Extra Large Landing Gear doubles Large's model dimensions. Its centered mount and moving parts reserve a three-by-three footprint; extension remains configurable from 0–4 blocks.
- Programmable Light Frame, a one-pixel-deep light panel, and Programmable Light Slab, a half-height light with top and bottom placement. Both use Programmable Light artwork, brightness, joining, redstone channels and configuration.
- Ramp Controller start and end offset sliders with half-block steps from -16 to 16 blocks. The controller, moving cells, saved settings and copied items retain these intermediate positions.

### Fixed

- Extra Large Landing Gear now uses a smaller, centered hotbar icon that fits its slot.
- Dynmap now reads Programmable Slab halves, Programmable Door facing and open state, and the clipped shapes and saved main finish of deployed Ramp cells. Propulsion emitter faces have enough depth to remain visible on the map.
- Newly placed Programmable Slabs now use Tile for their side layout by default; saved Fit selections still render as Fit, and the inventory model matches the default.
- Filled, full-height Programmable Diagonal Walls now support Programmable Doors above them.
- Framed Programmable Doors align with the block boundary at either depth edge. Frameless doors keep one pixel of clearance so sliding leaves retract behind the neighboring block.
- Programmable Diagonal Walls now provide per-face normals for shader lighting.
- Defer programmable-light joining, saved-state channel changes and redstone-channel registration until after chunk tile loading finishes. Landing Gear and door load callbacks now use the same safe point.
- Ramp controllers, doors, displays and Landing Gear read power only from loaded neighboring chunks, preventing redstone checks from loading another chunk during a tile callback.
- Programmable Slabs report their full outer face as solid, so ceiling and floor attachments such as Mekanism Glow Panels can be placed on the matching half.
- Programmable Input and Programmable Half Input now show their screen on the underside when mounted beneath a ceiling.
- Ceiling-mounted Programmable Inputs, Programmable Half-Inputs and Programmable Half-Consoles now use near, middle or far positions across the ceiling face based on where it was clicked.
- Propulsion wall textures now cover the housing's sides, top, bottom, rear and front recess across the Rocket Thruster, Ion Drive, Plasma Vent, Impulse Engine and three hover fixtures. Their configuration dialog shows the selected texture.
- The live-client test lab now performs bulk integrated-server scene setup on the server thread, reducing its chunk-packet tile-map race during setup.
- Dynmap now has fallback geometry for programmable blocks and walls. Removed model entries for three texture-only names that Dynmap rejected as air.

## 1.1

See the [illustrated guide](docs/gallery/version-1.1.md) for examples and settings.

### Added

- Optional per-face texture overrides for Programmable Block, Slab and the new Programmable Stairs. Disabled by default; faces inherit the main texture unless overridden.
- Programmable Diagonal Portholes with four opening shapes, half/full width, half-height/full-width geometry, glass shade and joining controls.
- Half-height diagonal walls, independent Fill Inside/Outside controls, and a standalone Programmable Diagonal Half Console.
- Luxury and Military Seats with joining controls and adjustable height (±2 pixels). Default legs are one pixel taller than the original models.
- One configurable Landing Gear block with Small, Medium and Large sizes, animated extension/retraction, redstone modes and channels, and immediate size/length previews. Extension ranges from 0–4 blocks in half-block steps; all sizes use equally thick arms with tiled frame-interior metal.
- Glass Frame Interior and Door Interior finishes in programmable texture menus.
- Copifier/Duplifier crafting: combine a configured tool with programmable items to apply selected settings while retaining the tool. Copying also supports the new block options and face overrides.

### Changed

- Diagonal placement follows clicked edges; a dialog control reverses the slope. Tall and shallow portholes join along their diagonal, including compatible reversed pieces.
- Two stacked Programmable Slabs become a Programmable Block, preserving the placed slab's settings.
- Programmable Ramp texture matching is optional (enabled by default). Ramps accept Immersive Engineering slabs and preserve each moved block's finish.
- Programmable Door animation uses the client clock for smoother motion on slow servers.
- Diagonal Porthole and Luxury/Military Seat recipes use Industrial Alloy instead of Programmable Matter.
- Landing Gear uses the single `landing_gear` block ID; earlier side, static and separate-size variants were removed without remapping. Legacy Space Doors are hidden from the creative menu.
- Updated block guides, configuration documentation and screenshot galleries.

### Fixed

- Programmable Light housing showing through the artwork, including distant single/joined lights rendered through Forge's batched renderer.
- Missing or flickering glass at joined Circular Porthole seams.
- Diagonal corner fills extending past corners or removing connecting sections; filled shallow undersides now use the main texture with correct UVs.
- Diagonal orientation after WorldEdit flips, and BetterBuildersWands `/wandOops` undo for affected blocks.
- Programmable Door and Half Input placement on Programmable Slabs, plus door removal crashes.
- A one-pixel seam on the Programmable Ramp controller.
- Landing Gear retraction, obstruction/reservation cleanup and saved settings; seat and gear inventory icons fit their slots.
- TextureFix sprite cleanup crashes and startup crashes caused by redstone-light initialization loading neighbouring chunks.
- Copying a block with face overrides disabled leaves them disabled without replacing stored face textures.

## 1.0
